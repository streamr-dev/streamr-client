  Streamr JavaScript Client
</h1>

By using this client, you can easily interact with the [Streamr](https://streamr.network) API from JavaScript-based environments, such as browsers and [node.js](https://nodejs.org). You can, for example, subscribe to real-time data in streams, produce new data to streams, and create new streams.

The client uses websockets for producing and consuming messages to/from streams. It should work in all modern browsers.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript)

## Breaking changes notice

* Date TBD: Support for unsigned data will be dropped.

## Installation

The client is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamr-client) and can be installed simply by:

`npm install streamr-client`

Node v14 or higher is recommended if you intend to use the client in a Node environment. For example, inside a script.

## Usage

Here are some quick examples. More detailed examples for the browser and node.js can be found [here](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client/tree/master/examples).

If you don't have an Ethereum account you can use the utility function `StreamrClient.generateEthereumAccount()`, which returns the address and private key of a fresh Ethereum account.

### Creating a StreamrClient instance

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    auth: {
        privateKey: 'your-private-key'
    }
})
```

When using Node.js remember to require the library with:

```js
const StreamrClient = require('streamr-client')
```

### Subscribing to real-time events in a stream

```js
const sub = await client.subscribe({
    stream: 'streamId',
    partition: 0, // Optional, defaults to zero. Use for partitioned streams to select partition.
    // optional resend options here
}, (message, metadata) => {
    // This is the message handler which gets called for every incoming message in the stream.
    // Do something with the message here!
})
```

### Resending historical data

```js
const sub = await client.resend({
    stream: 'streamId',
    resend: {
        last: 5,
    },
}, (message) => {
    // This is the message handler which gets called for every received message in the stream.
    // Do something with the message here!
})
```

See "Subscription options" for resend options

### Programmatically creating a stream

```js
const stream = await client.getOrCreateStream({
    name: 'My awesome stream created via the API',
})
console.log(`Stream ${stream.id} has been created!`)
// Do something with the stream, for example call stream.publish(message)
```

### Publishing data points to a stream

```js
// Here's our example data point
const msg = {
    temperature: 25.4,
    humidity: 10,
    happy: true
}

// Publish using the stream id only
await client.publish('my-stream-id', msg)

// The first argument can also be the stream object
await client.publish(stream, msg)

// Publish with a specific timestamp as a Date object (default is now)
await client.publish('my-stream-id', msg, new Date(54365472))

// Publish with a specific timestamp in ms
await client.publish('my-stream-id', msg, 54365472)

// Publish with a specific timestamp as a ISO8601 string
await client.publish('my-stream-id', msg, '2019-01-01T00:00:00.123Z')

// Publish with a specific partition key (read more about partitioning further down this readme)
await client.publish('my-stream-id', msg, Date.now(), 'my-partition-key')

// For convenience, stream.publish(...) equals client.publish(stream, ...)
await stream.publish(msg)
```

| publishWithSignature     | 'auto'                           | Determines if data points published to streams are signed or not. Possible values are: 'auto', 'always' and 'never'. Signing requires `auth.privateKey` or `auth.ethereum`.  'auto' will sign only if one of them is set. 'always' will throw an exception if none of them is set.                                                      |
| verifySignatures         | 'auto'                           | Determines under which conditions signed and unsigned data points are accepted or rejected. 'always' accepts only signed and verified data points. 'never' accepts all data points. 'auto' verifies all signed data points before accepting them and accepts unsigned data points only for streams not supposed to contain signed data. |

Otherwise an explicit call to `connect()` is required.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| autoDisconnect           | true                             | If set to `true`, the client automatically disconnects when the last stream is unsubscribed.

| orderMessages            | true                             | If set to `true`, the subscriber handles messages in the correct order, requests missing messages and drops duplicates. Otherwise, the subscriber processes messages as they arrive without any check.                                                                                                                                  |

## Authentication options

Note: **Authenticating with an API key has been deprecated.**

Note: **Support for email/password authentication will be dropped in the future and cryptographic keys/wallets will be the only supported method.**

If you don't have an Ethereum account you can use the utility function `StreamrClient.generateEthereumAccount()`, which returns the address and private key of a fresh Ethereum account.

Authenticating with Ethereum also automatically creates an associated Streamr user, even if it doesn't already exist. Under the hood, the client will cryptographically sign a challenge to authenticate you as a Streamr user:

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    auth: {
        privateKey: 'your-private-key'
    }
})
```

Authenticating with an Ethereum private key contained in an Ethereum (web3) provider:

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    auth: {
        ethereum: window.ethereum,
    }
})
```

(Authenticating with a pre-existing session token, for internal use by the Streamr app):

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    auth: {
        sessionToken: 'session-token'
    }
})
```

## Connecting

By default the client will automatically connect and disconnect as needed, ideally you should not need to manage connection state explicitly.
Specifically, it will automatically connect when you publish or subscribe, and automatically disconnect once all subscriptions are removed and no
messages were recently published. This behaviour can be disabled using the `autoConnect` & `autoDisconnect` options when creating a `new
StreamrClient`. Explicit calls to either `connect()` or `disconnect()` will disable all `autoConnect` & `autoDisconnect` functionality, but they can
be re-enabled by calling `enableAutoConnect()` or `enableAutoDisconnect()`.

Calls that need a connection, such as `publish` or `subscribe` will fail with an error if you are disconnected and autoConnect is disabled.

| Name                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| connect()                           | Safely connects if not connected. Returns a promise. Resolves immediately if already connected. Only rejects if an error occurs during connection.                                                  |
| disconnect()                        | Safely disconnects if not already disconnected, clearing all subscriptions. Returns a Promise.  Resolves immediately if already disconnected. Only rejects if an error occurs during disconnection. |
| enableAutoConnect(enable = true)    | Enables autoConnect if it wasn't already enabled. Does not connect immediately. Use `enableAutoConnect(false)` to disable autoConnect.                                                              |
| enableAutoDisconnect(enable = true) | Enables autoDisconnect if it wasn't already enabled. Does not disconnect immediately. Use `enableAutoConnect(false)` to disable autoDisconnect.                                                     |

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    auth: {
        privateKey: 'your-private-key'
    },
    autoConnect: false,
    autoDisconnect: false,
})

await client.connect()
```

## Managing subscriptions

| Name                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| subscribe(options, callback) | Subscribes to a stream. Messages in this stream are passed to the `callback` function. See below for subscription options. Returns a Promise resolving a `Subscription` object. |
| unsubscribe(Subscription)    | Unsubscribes the given `Subscription`. Returns a promise.                                                                                                                       |
| unsubscribeAll(`streamId`)   | Unsubscribes all `Subscriptions` for `streamId`. Returns a promise.                                                                                                             |
| getSubscriptions(`streamId`) | Returns a list of `Subscriptions` for `streamId`. Returns a promise.                                                                                                            |

### Message handler callback

The second argument to `client.subscribe(options, callback)` is the callback function that will be called for each message as they arrive. Its arguments are as follows:

| Argument      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| payload       | A JS object containing the message payload itself                                                                                                                                                                                |
| streamMessage | The whole [StreamMessage](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-protocol-js/blob/master/src/protocol/message_layer/StreamMessage.js) object containing various metadata, for example `streamMessage.getTimestamp()` etc. |

```js
const sub = await client.subscribe({
    streamId: 'my-stream-id',
}, (payload, streamMessage) => {
    console.log({
        payload, streamMessage
    })
})

```

### Subscription Options

Note that only one of the resend options can be used for a particular subscription. The default functionality is to resend nothing, only subscribe to messages from the subscription moment onwards.

| Name      | Description                                                                        |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stream    | Stream id to subscribe to                                                          |
| partition | Partition number to subscribe to. Defaults to partition 0.                         |
| resend    | Object defining the resend options. Below are examples of its contents.            |
| groupKeys | Object defining the group key as a hex string for each publisher id of the stream. |

```js
// Resend N most recent messages
const sub1 = await client.subscribe({
    streamId: 'my-stream-id',
    resend: {
        last: 10,
    }
}, onMessage)

// Resend from a specific message reference up to the newest message
const sub2 = await client.subscribe({
    streamId: 'my-stream-id',
    resend: {
        from: {
            timestamp: 12345,
            sequenceNumber: 0, // optional
        },
        publisher: 'publisherId', // optional
        msgChainId: 'msgChainId', // optional
    }
}, onMessage)

// Resend a limited range of messages
const sub3 = await client.subscribe({
    streamId: 'my-stream-id',
    resend: {
        from: {
            timestamp: 12345,
            sequenceNumber: 0, // optional
        },
        to: {
            timestamp: 54321,
            sequenceNumber: 0, // optional
        },
        publisher: 'publisherId', // optional
        msgChainId: 'msgChainId', // optional
    }
}, onMessage)
```

If you choose one of the above resend options when subscribing, you can listen on the completion of this resend by doing the following:

```js
const sub = await client.subscribe(options)
sub.on('resent', () => {
    console.log('All caught up and received all requested historical messages! Now switching to real time!')
})
```

## Stream API

## Data Unions

This library provides functions for working with Data Unions. To get a DataUnion instance, call `client.getDataUnion(address)`. To deploy a new DataUnion, call `deployDataUnion(options)`

TODO: All `options`-parameters should be documented (see TypeScript interfaces for the definitions)

These DataUnion-specific options are used from `StreamrClient` options:
| Property                 | Default                                                | Description                                                                                                      |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tokenAddress             | 0x0Cf0Ee637<br>88A0849fE52<br>97F3407f701<br>E122cC023 | Token used by the DU                                                                                             |
| factoryMainnetAddress    | TODO                                                   | Data Union factory that creates a new Data Union                                                                 |
| minimumWithdrawTokenWei  | 1000000                                                | Threshold value set in AMB configs, smallest token amount that can pass over the bridge                          |


### Admin Functions

| Name                                                                        | Returns             | Description                                                    |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| createSecret(\[name])                                                       | string              | Create a secret for a Data Union                               |
| addMembers(memberAddressList, \[options])                                   | Transaction receipt | Add members                                                    |
| removeMembers(memberAddressList, \[options])                                | Transaction receipt | Remove members from Data Union                                 |
| withdrawAllToMember(memberAddress, \[options])                              |                     |                                                                |
| withdrawAllToSigned(memberAddress, recipientAddress, signature, \[options]) |                     |                                                                |
| setAdminFee(newFeeFraction)                                                 | Transaction receipt | `newFeeFraction` is a `Number` between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) |

Here's an example how to deploy a data union contract and set the admin fee:

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    auth: { privateKey },
})

const dataUnion = await client.deployDataUnion()
await client.setAdminFee(0.3, { dataUnion })
```

### Member functions

| Name                                                            | Returns             | Description                                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| isMember(memberAddress)                                         | boolean             |                                                                             |
| withdrawAll(\[options])                                         | Transaction receipt | Withdraw funds from Data Union                                              |
| withdrawAllTo(recipientAddress, \[options])                     | Transaction receipt | Donate/move your earnings to recipientAddress instead of your memberAddress |
| signWithdrawAllTo(recipientAddress)                             | Signature (string)  | Signature that can be used to withdraw tokens to given recipientAddress     |
| signWithdrawAmountTo(recipientAddress, amountTokenWei)          | Signature (string)  | Signature that can be used to withdraw tokens to given recipientAddress     |

Here's an example how to sign off on a withdraw to (any) recipientAddress:

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    auth: { privateKey },
    dataUnion,
})

const signature = await client.signWithdrawAllTo(recipientAddress)
```

### Query functions

These are available for everyone and anyone, to query publicly available info from a Data Union:

| Name                                                       | Returns                                        | Description                             |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| getStats()                                                 | {activeMemberCount, totalEarnings, ...}        | Get Data Union's statistics             |
| getMemberStats(memberAddress)                              | {earnings, proof, ...}                         | Get member's stats                      |
| getWithdrawableEarnings(memberAddress)                     | `BigNumber` withdrawable DATA tokens in the DU |                                         |
| getAdminFee()                                              | `Number` between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive)       | Admin's cut from revenues               |
| getAdminAddress()                                          | Ethereum address                               | Data union admin's address              |
| getVersion()                                               | `0`, `1` or `2`                                | `0` if the contract is not a data union |

Here's an example how to get a member's withdrawable token balance (in "wei", where 1 DATA = 10^18 wei)

```js
const client = new StreamrClient({
    dataUnion,
})

const withdrawableWei = await client.getMemberBalance(memberAddress)
```

## Utility functions

## Events

The client and the subscriptions can fire events as detailed below.
You can bind to them using `on`.

| Name                                | Description                                                                              |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| on(eventName, function)             | Binds a `function` to an event called `eventName`                                        |
| once(eventName, function)           | Binds a `function` to an event called `eventName`. It gets called once and then removed. |
| removeListener(eventName, function) | Unbinds the `function` from events called `eventName`                                    |

### Events on the StreamrClient instance

| Name         | Handler Arguments | Description                                                      |

| error        | Error             | Fired when the client encounters an error e.g. connection issues |

```js
// The StreamrClient emits various events
client.on('connected', () => {
    // note no need to wait for this before doing work,
    // with autoconnect enabled the client will happily establish a connection for you as required.
    console.log('Yeah, we are connected now!')
})
```

### Events on the Subscription object

## Partitioning

Partitioning (sharding) enables streams to scale horizontally. This section describes how to use partitioned streams via this library. To learn the basics of partitioning, see [the docs](https://streamr.network/docs/streams#partitioning).

### Creating partitioned streams

By default, streams only have 1 partition when they are created. The partition count can be set to any positive number (1-100 is reasonable). An example of creating a partitioned stream using the JS client:

```js
const stream = await client.createStream({
    name: 'My partitioned stream',
    partitions: 10,
})
console.log(`Stream created: ${stream.id}. It has ${stream.partitions} partitions.`)
```

### Publishing to partitioned streams

In most use cases, a user wants related events (e.g. events from a particular device) to be assigned to the same partition, so that the events retain a deterministic order and reach the same subscriber(s) to allow them to compute stateful aggregates correctly.

The library allows the user to choose a _partition key_, which simplifies publishing to partitioned streams by not requiring the user to assign a partition number explicitly. The same partition key always maps to the same partition. In an IoT use case, the device id can be used as partition key; in user interaction data it could be the user id, and so on.

The partition key can be given as an argument to the `publish` methods, and the library assigns a deterministic partition number automatically:

```js
await client.publish('my-stream-id', msg, Date.now(), msg.vehicleId)

// or, equivalently
await stream.publish(msg, Date.now(), msg.vehicleId)
```

### Subscribing to partitioned streams

By default, the JS client subscribes to the first partition (partition `0`) in a stream. The partition number can be explicitly given in the subscribe call:

```js
const sub = await client.subscribe({
    stream: 'my-stream-id',
    partition: 4, // defaults to 0
}, (payload) => {
    console.log('Got message %o', payload)
})
```

Or, to subscribe to multiple partitions, if the subscriber can handle the volume:

```js
const handler = (payload, streamMessage) => {
    console.log('Got message %o from partition %d', payload, streamMessage.getStreamPartition())
}

await Promise.all([2, 3, 4].map(async (partition) => {
    await client.subscribe({
        stream: 'my-stream-id',
        partition,
    }, handler)
}))
```

## Logging

The Streamr JS client library supports [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) for logging.

In node.js, start your app like this: `DEBUG=StreamrClient* node your-app.js`

In the browser, set `localStorage.debug = 'StreamrClient*'`

## For Developers

Publishing to npm is automated via Github Actions. Follow the steps below to publish `latest` or `beta`.

### Publishing `latest`

1.  Update version with either `npm version [patch|minor|major]`. Use
    semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>. Files package.json and
    package-lock.json will be automatically updated, and an appropriate
    git commit and tag created.

2.  `git push --follow-tags`

3.  Wait for Github Actions to run tests

4.  If tests passed, Github Actions will publish the new version to npm

### Publishing `beta`

1.  Update version with either `npm version [prepatch|preminor|premajor] --preid=beta`. Use semantic versioning
    <https://semver.org/>. Files package.json and package-lock.json will be automatically updated, and an appropriate git commit and tag created.

2.  `git push --follow-tags`

3.  Wait for Github Actions to run tests

4.  If tests passed, Github Actions will publish the new version to npm
