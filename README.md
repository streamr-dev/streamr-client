## Streamr Javascript Client

By using this client, you can easily subscribe to realtime [Streamr](http://www.streamr.com) streams from Javascript-based environments, such as browsers and [node.js](https://nodejs.org). This enables you to use Streamr as an over-the-internet pub/sub engine with powerful analytics and automation features.

The client uses websockets for streaming message delivery. It should work in all modern browsers.

### Installation

The client is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamr-client) and can be installed simpy by:

`npm install streamr-client`

### Usage

Here's a quick example. More detailed examples for the browser and node.js can be found [here](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client/tree/master/examples).

```javascript
// Create a StreamrClient instance
var client = new StreamrClient({
    // See below for options
})

// Subscribe to a stream
var sub = client.subscribe(
    {
        stream: 'streamId',
        partition: 0,           // Optional, defaults to zero. Use for partitioned streams to select partition.
        apiKey: 'secret'      // Optional. If not given, uses the apiKey given at client creation time.
        // optional resend options here
    },
    function(message, metadata) {
        // Do something with the message, which is an object
    }
)
```

### Client options

Option | Default value | Description
------ | ------------- | -----------
url | wss://www.streamr.com/api/v1/ws | Address of the Streamr websocket endpoint to connect to.
apiKey | null | Define default apiKey to use when none is specified in the call to `client.subscribe`.
autoConnect | true | If set to `true`, the client connects automatically on the first call to `subscribe()`. Otherwise an explicit call to `connect()` is required.
autoDisconnect | true Â | If set to `true`, the client automatically disconnects when the last stream is unsubscribed. Otherwise the connection is left open and can be disconnected explicitly by calling `disconnect()`.

### Message handler callback

The second argument to `client.subscribe(options, callback)` is the callback function that will be called for each message as they arrive. Its arguments are as follows:

Argument | Description
-------- | -----------
message  | A javascript object containing the message itself
metadata | Metadata for the message, for example `metadata.timestamp` etc.

### Methods

Name | Description
---- | -----------
connect() | Connects to the server, and also subscribes to any streams for which `subscribe()` has been called before calling `connect()`.
disconnect() | Disconnects from the server, clearing all subscriptions.
pause() | Disconnects from the server without clearing subscriptions.
subscribe(options, callback) | Subscribes to a stream. Messages in this stream are passed to the `callback` function. See below for subscription options. Returns a `Subscription` object.
unsubscribe(Subscription) | Unsubscribes the given `Subscription`.
unsubscribeAll(`streamId`) | Unsubscribes all `Subscriptions` for `streamId`.
getSubscriptions(`streamId`) | Returns a list of `Subscriptions` for `streamId`.
bind(eventName, function) | Binds a `function` to an event called `eventName`
unbind(eventName, function) | Unbinds the `function` from events called `eventName`

### Subscription options

Note that only one of the resend options can be used for a particular subscription. The default functionality is to resend nothing, only subscribe to messages from the subscription moment onwards.

Name | Description
---- | -----------
stream    | Stream id to subscribe to
apiKey   | User key or stream key that authorizes the subscription. If defined, overrides the client's `apiKey`.
partition | Partition number to subscribe to. Defaults to the default partition (0).
resend_all | Set to `true` if you want all the messages for the stream resent from the earliest available message.
resend_last | Resend the previous `N` messages.
resend_from | Resend from a specific message number.
resend_from_time | Resend from a specific Date (or millisecond timestamp).
resend_to | Can be used in conjunction with `resend_from` to limit the end of the resend. By default it is the newest message.

### Binding to events

The client and the subscriptions can fire events as detailed below. You can bind to them using `bind`:

```javascript
	function hello() {
		console.log('Hello!')
	}

	client.bind('connected', hello)

	var sub = client.subscribe(...)
	sub.bind('subscribed', function() {
		console.log('Subscribed to '+sub.streamId)
	})
```

You can unbind using `unbind`:

```javascript
	client.unbind('connected', hello)
```


### Events on the StreamrClient instance

Name | Handler Arguments | Description
---- | ----------------- | -----------
connected |  | Fired when the client has connected (or reconnected).
disconnected |  | Fired when the client has disconnected (or paused).

### Events on the Subscription object

Name | Handler Arguments | Description
---- | ----------------- | -----------
subscribed | {from: number} | Fired when a subscription request is acknowledged by the server.
unsubscribed |  | Fired when an unsubscription is acknowledged by the server.
resending |  | Fired when the subscription starts resending.
resent |  | Fired after `resending` when the subscription has finished resending.
no_resend |  | Fired after `resending` in case there was nothing to resend.

### Logging

The Streamr JS client library supports [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) for logging.

In node.js, start your app like this: `DEBUG=StreamrClient node your-app.js`

In the browser, include `debug.js` and set `localStorage.debug = 'StreamrClient'`
